    "text": "## Act I: Analytical Geometry\r\n\r\nAnalytical geometry is the study of the relationship between geometrical objects -- circles, lines, triangles, and such -- and their description as mathematical formulas. This ends up being central to calculus, because the keystone ideas of calculus are geometric but are written in mathematical notation.\r\n\r\nWithout that geometric perspective, the formulas are just piles of \\(\\int\\) letters and signs with mysterious rules. So Act I is drills-for-skills about how to see graphs and formulas as two different ways of looking at the same thing, and getting good at hopping between the two forms.\r\n\r\n## Act II: Limits, \\(\\lim_{x\\to\\alpha}f(x)\\)\r\n\r\nAnother important hurdle to get over, this time conceptual, is the question of how to involve infinity in your calculations without sounding like Professor Hairguy.\r\n\r\nThe key insight is that infinity isn't a number but a direction. You can meaningfully talk about the result of an infinite calculation by studying the result of a similar but finite calculation, and watching what it looks like as you move it closer and closer to being an infinite calculation, until you get a sense of where it's headed. That's the process of taking a limit.\r\n\r\n## Act III: Differential Calculus, \\(f'(x)\\)\r\n\r\nOne of the two crown jewels of Calc I. Roughly speaking, it's about building a challenge-and-response skill: if I give you \\(f(x)\\), can you give me the related function \\(f'(x)\\) that holds the same basic relationship to as, say, speed does to position, or acceleration does to speed?\r\n\r\nThe good news is that this one isn't so tough, compared to the climb to get there. There are rules to memorize, but not that many.\r\n\r\n## Act IV: Integral Calculus, \\(\\int f(x)dx\\)\r\n\r\nThis part amounts to doing the previous part backward -- going from acceleration to speed, or from speed to distance. As the \\(\\int\\) symbol hints at, you can think of it as a kind of extended version of summation (\\(\\int\\) for \"summa\") for adding up things that are constantly changing.\r\n\r\nSo if I give you \\(f(x)\\), can you give me the related function \\(\\int f(x)dx\\), which is sorta \\(f(x)\\) added up as \\(x\\) is changing? The bad news is, this one is hard. There's some guesswork and trial-and-error, and there used to be [tomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradshteyn_and_Ryzhik) that were nothing but tables for looking integrals up. \r\n\r\n(Aside: in the last, say, 50 years, mathematicians came up with a [computer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm) for this, but it's *wa-a-a-ay* different than what you're taught in Calc I, is really complicated, basically takes a computer to keep all the details straight, and understanding it is on my bucket list.)",
