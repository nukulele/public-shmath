## Vue

- get the `ScratchEdit` page going -- done!
- get the `Entry` detail page going -- done!
    - need to get the next tick thing going -- done!

- monkey more with `graphql` -- done!

- get the various list pages going
    - `tagList` 
        - with pagination
    - `entryList` 
        - with pagination
        - with filtering
        - with ordering (stretch goal)
 
- make sure all `Vue`-generated links are correct

- learn how to do type-checking in `Vue` components
- error checking for bad graphql responses
- also, get better on passing properties

- It'd be fun to unroll the mathpage entry via a transition.
